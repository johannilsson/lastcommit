# You are only as good as your last commit

JavaScript widget to include on your site that shows and links to your last commit on GitHub.

``` html
<span class="lastcommit-widget" data-user="your github username"></span>
<script src="http://johannilsson.github.com/lastcommit/widget.js"></script>
```

* It's not smart enough to filter out commits by others in a repository.
* Does not work properly on commits in branches.
